- [x] Troubleshooting Server 20.04 Clipboard Issues

There was some problem with the clipboard during my installation of lamp stack when I wanted to copy commands. I used these articles to troubleshoot, finally I managed to fix the issue with these 2 commands
* [Copy/paste and drag & drop not working in VMware machine with Ubuntu](https://askubuntu.com/questions/691585/copy-paste-and-dragdrop-not-working-in-vmware-machine-with-ubuntu) 
* [Copy/paste not working in VMware](https://askubuntu.com/questions/985924/copy-paste-not-working-in-vmware/994361)

```
$ sudo apt-get install open-vm-tools-desktop
$ sudo reboot
```


- [ ] LAMP/XAMPP Stack installation üöß

1. Apache 2
```
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install apache2 -y
$ sudo ufw app info "Apache Full"
$ sudo ufw allow in "Apache Full"
```
Testing: now you can try to access the web server by going to http://xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx which is your ip address (run `ifconfig`) or using `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` (loopback).
